## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Running the Server

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rust-web-backend
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the server:
